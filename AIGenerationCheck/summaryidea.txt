The Media Check
This checks the image or video attached to a post.

A: Is it AI-generated?

Tool: Use a deepfake/AI detection API.

APIs: Hive Moderation, Eden AI, or Reality Defender all have APIs to detect AI-generated images and video. Most have a free tier perfect for a hackathon.

B: Is it out of context?

Tool: Use a Reverse Image Search API.

APIs: TinEye API (the professional standard) or SerpApi / Google Custom Search API (to "scrape" Google reverse image search results).

Your Logic:

Extract the image from the tweet.

Send it to the reverse image search API.

Find the oldest known date the image appeared online.

Compare oldest_image_date to the tweet_date.

Red Flag: If oldest_image_date is from 2015 and the tweet claims it happened "today," you've found misinformation.
