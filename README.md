##  Inspiration
The main inspiration came from the prompt:  
> "Accurate Information is really important for making decisions. Create something that helps understand information accuracy — for example, social media posts, news headlines, economic predictions, AI responses, etc."

For this, we were inspired by the various aspects of the prompt and decided to create a website that collates tools to detect and assess the accuracy of information sources such as:  
- Images  
- Twitter/X accounts  
- Twitter posts verification  


## What It Does
The project was split into various applications which were connected via a Flask back end to a unified website.  

The project consisted of three major parts:  
1. **Image Classification** — Detect whether an image is AI-generated or not.  
2. **Twitter Account Identification** — Determine if a Twitter/X account is operated by a bot or a human.  
3. **Claim Checker** — Verify the factual accuracy of a post or claim using data and API-based analysis.  

These parts were integrated into a Python Flask back end to create a cohesive web application.  
The front end was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** for interactivity and responsiveness.  



## How We Built It




##  What We Learned
As a team, we gained valuable experience in:  
- Integrating **machine learning systems** and **web technologies** into a unified product.  
- Designing **API-driven workflows** for seamless data exchange between front end and back end systems.  
- Using **Flask** for scalable back-end development and **fetch-based asynchronous communication**.  
- Building **intuitive and consistent UI/UX** for multi-tool applications.  
- Managing teamwork and **version control** across multiple components using **Git** and **GitHub**.  

##  What's Next for ClearReality
Moving forward, we plan to:  
- Integrate **real-time data APIs** for improved claim verification accuracy.  
- Expand the platform to assess **news articles** and **AI-generated text**.  
- Improve our models using **larger, labeled datasets** for better detection performance.  
- Deploy the site publicly and add **user accounts** and **reporting features** for broader impact.  

Our goal is to evolve this into a robust, **AI-powered misinformation detection suite** that helps people make informed, data-driven decisions online.
